## Episode Summary

Episode 5 concludes the series by examining how Nordic design has evolved in the 21st century. The contemporary period (2000-2025) is characterized by a fundamental shift toward environmental consciousness and sustainability. Designers like Daniel Rybakken, Jonas Edvard, and Cecilie Manz represent a generation that has grown up with climate awareness and has integrated these concerns into their design philosophy.

The episode emphasizes that modern Nordic designers are not just creating beautiful objects, but are actively working to solve environmental problems through innovative use of materials and sustainable design practices. This represents both a continuation of Nordic design values (functionality, natural materials, connection to nature) and a necessary evolution to meet contemporary global challenges.

The series concludes with the notion that Nordic design in the 2000s and beyond continues to influence global design culture, but now with an added responsibility to address climate change and environmental sustainability - making design not just about aesthetics or function, but about planetary stewardship.
